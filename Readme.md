## Phase 3 iOS app

This app is development using **Xcode 10.2** and written in **Swift 5**

It uses **Cocoapods** as external dependency manager.

Make sure to have Xcode installed. It can be found in the macOS App Store. **After Xcode is installed, make sure to run it at least once and install the Command Line Tools**.

To install Cocoapods, run `sudo gem install cocoapods`, although `sudo` is not recommended.

After Cocoapods is installed, navigate to project's folder.

Run `pod install` and then open the **.xcworkspace** file in Xcode and run the app in Simulator
